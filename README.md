# Exercism Solutions

I really value being a polyglot developer and also enjoy structured, incremental learning, which makes [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) a really great tool.
I like the social aspect and I think having the ability to add new exercises or mentor others is really great.

I think their platform is phenomenal, but I also really like having all of my code in source control and I like having places on-platform in github to inspect source.

This repo is my attempt to keep my exercise solutions in sync with Exercism, using their CLI and git.

## Opening issues

Feel free to open issues or PRs as a form of discussing a solution. I can't promise I'll accept changes, but I love discussing solutions.
