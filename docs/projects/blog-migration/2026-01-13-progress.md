## Session Summary

Initial planning session for migrating djf.io from Starlight to a custom Astro setup.

## Work Completed

- Analyzed current site structure and dependencies
- Created project documentation structure at `docs/`
- Documented migration plan with 8 phases
- Established documentation conventions in `CLAUDE.md`
- Finalized decisions on tags, search, and archive navigation

## Current State Assessment

The site is well-positioned for migration:

- **PandaCSS already configured** - No styling framework changes needed
- **React 19 already installed** - Can use React components
- **Minimal content** - Only 4 pages to migrate (1 home + 3 blog posts)
- **Clean Starlight setup** - No custom theme overrides to untangle

## Key Decisions

1. **Content structure**: Move from `src/content/docs/blog/` to `src/content/blog/`
2. **Layouts**: Create three layouts - Base, BlogPost, and Page
3. **Routing**: Use Astro's file-based routing with dynamic `[...slug]` for blog
4. **Design approach**: Start with dark mode support built-in
5. **Tags**: Yes - `/blog/tags/` index and `/blog/tags/[tag]` archives
6. **Search**: Pagefind for static build-time search (same engine as Starlight, framework-agnostic)
7. **Archives**: Blog index groups posts by year/month with jump navigation for quick seeking

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Create new content collection schemas
2. Design the base layout structure
3. Start with navigation component (Home, Blog, Search)

## Resolved Questions

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Tag pages? | Yes - `/blog/tags/[tag]` for filtered lists |
| Search? | Pagefind - static, build-time, ~5kb runtime |
| Date archives? | Grouped index with year/month + jump nav |

## Blockers

None at this time.
