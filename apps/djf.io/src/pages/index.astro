    <h2>AI Attribution & Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>
      I have not used generative AI, nor will I use any for generating written content on this
      site. My goal is to express my ideas in written form. I utilize tools like Grammarly and
      Hemingway to improve my writing, but I do not use generative fills or "rewrite this
      sentence/paragraph" mechanics. I follow grammar and spelling suggestions and auto-corrections
      for voice and tense. I use these tools because I make mistakes, not because I need them to
      write for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I use Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E to generate illustrations for my posts when writing
      alone might be too dry. My goal is to move away from using these tools exclusively, but since
      I'm not an artist, that may take time. I will do my best to identify all AI-generated images.
