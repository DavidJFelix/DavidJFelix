## Session Summary

Initial planning session for migrating djf.io from Starlight to a custom Astro setup.

## Work Completed

- Analyzed current site structure and dependencies
- Created project documentation structure at `docs/`
- Documented migration plan with 7 phases
- Established documentation conventions in `CLAUDE.md`

## Current State Assessment

The site is well-positioned for migration:

- **PandaCSS already configured** - No styling framework changes needed
- **React 19 already installed** - Can use React components
- **Minimal content** - Only 4 pages to migrate (1 home + 3 blog posts)
- **Clean Starlight setup** - No custom theme overrides to untangle

## Key Decisions

1. **Content structure**: Move from `src/content/docs/blog/` to `src/content/blog/`
2. **Layouts**: Create three layouts - Base, BlogPost, and Page
3. **Routing**: Use Astro's file-based routing with dynamic `[...slug]` for blog
4. **Design approach**: Start with dark mode support built-in

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Create new content collection schemas
2. Design the base layout structure
3. Decide on navigation approach (minimal vs. full nav)

## Open Questions

- Should tags have their own pages (`/blog/tags/[tag]`)?
- Include search functionality?
- Archive/date-based navigation for blog posts?

## Blockers

None at this time.
