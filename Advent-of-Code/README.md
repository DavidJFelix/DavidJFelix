# Advent of Code
A repository for sharing Advent of Code submissions

# Structure

The folder structure follows this order:

`<Year>/day<Day Number>/<Language>/<Github User Name>`

For example, in 2019, on day 1, @DavidJFelix wants to show off a Kotlin native solution, that would go in the folder:

`2019/day1/kotlin-native/@davidjfelix`

Note the use of `kebab-case` for the language and `lowercase` for the username.
This is style scheme will be used to prevent case-based conflicts for people with case-insensitive file systems.
