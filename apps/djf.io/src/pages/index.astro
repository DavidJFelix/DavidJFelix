          I have not used generative AI, nor will I use any for generating written content
          on this site. My goal is to express my ideas in written form. I utilize tools like
          Grammarly and Hemingway to improve my writing, but I do not use generative fills
          or "rewrite this sentence/paragraph" mechanics. I follow grammar and spelling
          suggestions and auto-corrections for voice and tense. I use these tools because I
          make mistakes, not because I need them to write for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I use Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E to generate illustrations for my posts when
          writing alone might be too dry. My goal is to move away from using these tools
          exclusively, but since I'm not an artist, that may take time. I will do my best to
          identify all AI-generated images.
